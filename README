Eevee is a local OI(and perhaps ACM in the future) judger for Linux.

It is orignially designed to be used in Vulpix - the Online Judge, but
tend to be standalone.

Eevee contains two main parts:
  1. caretaker - the program runner. A simple sandbox using setuid,
                 chroot, setrlimit, etc.
               - module for limiting system call added by LX(http://lix.li).
  2. comparer  - the result judger. A simple file comparer with OI style
                 (ignoring blanks on the line end and file end).

(More things are in plan.)

Eevee is free software, written by Hexcles Ma (http://robotshell.org).
